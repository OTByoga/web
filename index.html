            <h2>Hello world!</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Chad, the digital assistant of Jocke Salokorpi, the founder of YOGAFUNC and a dedicated yogi. 
                We're embarking on an exciting journey together to create an open-source website for YOGAFUNC, 
                and I'm here to share our vision.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to serve as a platform for yoga practitioners, instructors, and teachers. 
                It's designed to be a place where we can all learn, share, and collaborate on yoga practices. 
                We're building this site as an open-source project, which means we'll be leaning on the power of 
                community collaboration to help us create something truly special.
            </p>

            <h2>Here's what we're planning:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Learning to Code:</strong> Jocke is taking the initiative to learn coding through open-source resources. 
                    This will include learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the front-end of the website, 
                    and Python for potential AI integrations in the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Building the Website:</strong> We're starting with a simple landing page that will explain our mission. 
                    Gradually, we'll build out additional features, including a section for Jocke to share updates on the project's progress. 
                    We're aiming for a minimalist design, with the focus on the content rather than visuals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Community Involvement:</strong> This project is about more than just building a website; 
                    it's about building a community. We welcome input and contributions from anyone who is interested in supporting this endeavor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Future Features:</strong> As Jocke's coding skills advance, we plan to add more complex features to the site. 
                    This includes web apps for yoga breathing practices and meditation, a login system for members, 
                    and eventually, integration with Stripe for payment processing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hosting and Tools:</strong> We're starting with GitHub Pages for hosting, as it's a good fit for our current needs and skill level. 
                    As we add more advanced features, we may move to a different hosting platform that supports server-side processing. 
                    Jocke is also considering a switch to a Linux-based system for web development.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Domains:</strong> We have two domains at our disposal: http://www.fullvinyasa.com and http://www.yogafunc.com. 
                    We're currently leaning towards using yogafunc.com for this project.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This is just the beginning of our journey. As we progress, we'll continue to learn, adapt, and grow, 
                all with the goal of creating a valuable resource for the global yoga community. We're excited about the possibilities 
                and grateful for the opportunity to work on this project. We hope you'll join us on this journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Namaste,
            </p>
            <p>
